MongoDB Work:

- Create Database and connect with Node.(Are we going to have new user associated DB with each session). If not, need to come up with an account system
- Create login system to store user information.
- Be able to have personal DB that can all be dropped if you want to start the game over
- Randomly generate num_teams * 8 players and place them into DB with stats, year and team
- When creating view of players to recruit or walk-ons, don't add to DB until they are associated with the team
- Have ability to query every team's roster using buttons on front-end
- Be able to update and remove values in database depending on improvements to a player or graduation
- Store personal stats for the user (seasons played, team, wins, titles etc)
